abstract = {The origin of the assemblage of ultra-high pressure (UHP), super-reduced (SuR) and several crustally derived phases in ophiolitic chromitites is still hotly debated. In this paper, we report, for the first time, this assemblage of phases in ophiolitic chromitites of the Caribbean. We studied the Mercedita chromitite deposit in the eastern Cuban ophiolitic complexes. The mineral phases were characterized using microRaman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy with a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDS), X-ray microdiffraction and electron microprobe analyses. Mineral concentrates were prepared using hydroseparation techniques. We have identified oriented clinopyroxene lamellae in chromite, oriented rutile lamellae in chromite, moissanite hosted in the altered matrix of the chromitite, graphite-like amorphous carbon, corundum and SiO2 hosted in healed fractures in chromite grains, and native Cu and Fe–Mn alloy recovered in heavy-mineral concentrates obtained by hydroseparation. This assemblage may correspond to UHP-SuR conditions, implying recycling of chromitite in the mantle or formation of the chromite grains at deep mantle depths, followed by emplacement at a shallow level in the mantle. However, the chromitite bodies contain gabbro sills oriented parallel to the elongation of the chromitite lenses, and these show no evidence of HP/UHP metamorphism. Therefore, the identified “exotic” phases may not be indicative of UHP. They formed independently as oriented clinopyroxene lamellae in chromite during cooling (clinopyroxene and rutile), in super-reduced microenvironments during the serpentinization processes, and by transference of subducted crustal material to the mantle wedge via cold plumes.},

abstract = {Natural moissanite (SiC) is reported from mantle-derived samples ranging from lithospheric mantle keel diamonds to serpentinites to podiform chromitites in ophiolites related to suprasubduction zone settings (Luobusa, Dongqiao, Semail, and Ray-Iz). To simulate ultra-reducing conditions and the formation of moissanite, we compiled thermodynamic data for alloys (Fe–Si–C and Fe–Cr), carbides (Fe3C, Fe7C3, SiC), and Fe-silicides; these data were augmented by commonly used thermodynamic data for silicates and oxides. Computed phase diagram sections then constrain the P–T–fO2 conditions of SiC stability in the upper mantle. Our results demonstrate that: Moissanite only occurs at oxygen fugacities 6.5–7.5 log units below the iron–wustite buffer; moissanite and chromite cannot stably coexist; increasing pressure does not lead to the stability of this mineral pair; and silicates that coexist with moissanite have XMg {\textgreater} 0.99. At upper mantle conditions, chromite reduces to Fe–Cr alloy at fO2 values 3.7–5.3 log units above the moissanite-olivine-(ortho)pyroxene-carbon (graphite or diamond) buffer (MOOC). The occurrence of SiC in chromitites and the absence of domains with almost Fe-free silicates suggest that ultra-reducing conditions allowing for SiC are confined to grain scale microenvironments. In contrast to previous ultra-high-pressure and/or temperature hypotheses for SiC origin, we postulate a low to moderate temperature mechanism, which operates via ultra-reducing fluids. In this model, graphite-/diamond-saturated moderately reducing fluids evolve in chemical isolation from the bulk rock to ultra-reducing methane-dominated fluids by sequestering H2O into hydrous phases (serpentine, brucite, phase A). Carbon isotope compositions of moissanite are consistent with an origin of such fluids from sediments originally rich in organic compounds. Findings of SiC within rocks mostly comprised by hydrous phases (serpentine + brucite) support this model. Both the hydrous phases and the limited diffusive equilibration of SiC with most minerals in the rocks indicate temperatures below 700–800 °C. Moissanite from mantle environments is hence a mineral that does not inform on pressure but on a low to moderate temperature environment involving ultra-reduced fluids. Any mineral in equilibrium with SiC could only contain traces of Fe2+ or Cr3+.},

abstract = {The Purang ultramafic massif, located in the Yarlung-Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ) of the Tibetan Plateau, consists mainly of harzburgites and minor lherzolites. The spinel-bearing lherzolites of the NW part of the massif display a granular texture, consisting of large olivine and pyroxene crystals with curvilinear grain boundaries. These lherzolites contain chromian spinel (Cr-spinel) of low Cr{\#} [100 × Cr/(Cr +Al) = 24.7–30.2], enstatite with high Mg{\#} [100 × Mg/(Mg + Fe 2+ ) = 90.0–91.2] and relatively high Al 2 O 3 content (3.3–4.1 wt{\%}), and diopside with high Mg{\#} (90.2–93.3) and Al 2 O 3 content (4.6–5.0 wt{\%}). These compositions are analogous to those of spinel and pyroxenes from residual peridotites. However, the Purang lherzolites show U-shaped primitive mantle (PM)-normalized rare earth element (REE)-profiles, which are not consistent with a potential origin as melting residues. The high LREE contents and positive Ti anomalies shown by the investigated lherzolites coupled with the low TiO 2 content of their mineral constituents imply that these rocks possibly stored LREE- and Ti-bearing arc-related melts/fluids in their groundmass. A mineral assemblage composed of diamond, super-reduced [(SuR) moissanite, native Cr] and crustal-derived minerals (zircon, corundum, rutile), has been separated from the Purang lherzolites. Uranium-Pb geochronological dating of zircons yielded an age range between 1718 and 465 Ma, indicating that they represent ancient crustal material delivered into the upper mantle via previous subduction events. Diamonds and old zircons (± crustal minerals) were carried to shallow mantle levels by asthenospheric magmas produced during a slab rollback-induced decompression melting process. The recovery of SuR minerals is consistent with fluid percolation and crystallization of alteration-related minerals in the lithospheric parts of a (hydrated) mantle wedge, resulting in the formation of highly reduced micro-environments.},

@article{Proenza1999,
abstract = {The Mayari-Baracoa belt occupies the easternmost part of the east-west-trending Cuban ophiolitic belt. It comprises two large, chromite-rich massifs: Mayari-Cristal and Moa-Baracoa. Neither of these massifs show a complete ophiolite sequence, but they consist of a part of an ideal section made up of (1) harzburgites grading upward into interlayered harzburgites and dunites, (2) interlayered harzburgites (with minor dunites) and gabbros, (3) gabbros, microgabbros, dolerites, and diabase dikes, and (4) pillowed basalt, cherts, and radiolarites. Chromite deposits can be grouped into three mining districts according to the chemistry of chromite ore: the Mayari district and the Sagua de Tanamo district, both in the Mayari-Cristal massif, and the Moa-Baracoa district in the Moa-Baracoa massif. The latter is the most important as it contains more than 5.5 million tons of ore. All chromitites mainly exhibit massive texture, show a pseudotabular, lenticular shape, and are concordant with the foliation of the enclosing harzburgites. In Moa-Baracoa they tend to occur in the mantle-crust transition zone, commonly contain dunite and gabbro bodies oriented parallel to the elongation of the lenses, and are cut by late pegmatitic gabbro dikes. By contrast, in Mayari, and to some extent in Sagua de Tanamo, chromitites occur deeper in the mantle tectonites and are cut by websterite dikes. Intergranular minerals are olivine, serpentine, and chlorite. Chromite has abundant, randomly distributed solid inclusions of olivine and pargasite, and minor pyroxene, laurite, and millerite. Toward the contact with the included gabbros, chromitite from Moa-Baracoa shows increasing amounts of gabbro-related alteration products. Abundant clinopyroxene, partly altered plagioclase, and rutile occur as inclusions in the chromite. The composition of the chromite ore varies from typical refractory grade (Al rich) at Moa-Baracoa to metallurgical grade (Cr rich) at Mayari, where the Cr no. ranges between 0.41 and 0.75, the Mg no. between 0.57 and 0.81, and the TiO 2 content between 0.09 and 0.52 wt percent. At Moa-Baracoa, the Cr no. of chromite decreases and TiO 2 content increases from harzburgite to dunite and massive chromitite, positively correlated with the forsterite content of coexisting olivine. At Mayari, both the Cr no. and TiO 2 content of chromite, and the forsterite content of olivine increase from harzburgite to dunite and chromitite. Bulk platinum-group element abundances in chromitite vary from 20 to 538 ppb and show a broad positive correlation with Cr 2O 3 percent of chromite. The latter correlation is strongest in the Sagua de Tanamo district. Structural, textural, mineralogical, and chemical characteristics of the studied chromite deposits, as well as the lithophile trace element geochemistry of their host rocks, support a genetic model based on the crystallization of chromite from different types of melts (from back-arc basin basalts to boninitic andesites) at around 1,200°C, at variable f(O) 2. Chromite formed when calc-alkaline melts, formed by melt-rock reactions at increasing melt volume, percolated through subhorizontal, porous dunitic channels and mixed with oxidized melts formed by low degrees of hydrous melting and low-temperature melt-rock reactions in suprasubduction zone mantle. Mixing of these two melts generated a hybrid melt whose bulk composition fell within the chromite liquidus field in the P-T-f(O) 2 space (Hill and Roeder, 1974). Percolation of the hybrid melt through the dunitic channels promoted dissolution of preexisting silicate minerals and chromite crystallization. The Al-rich chromitites formed at the mantle crust transition zone of high f(O) 2 ({\~{}} log f(O) 2 = -7), whereas Cr-rich chromitites formed deeper in mantle tectonites under more reducing conditions, at log f(O) 2 {\~{}} = -10, depending on Cr contents of the parental magma.},

abstract = {Cuba is the largest island in the Greater Antilles, and its geology records three important episodes: (1) the Jurassic breakup of North and South America (Pangea) and associated passive margin and oceanic sedimentary and magmatic evolution; (2) the sedimentary, magmatic, and metamorphic evolution of an intra-oceanic Cretaceous-Paleogene ophiolite-Arc complex; and (3) the Paleogene "soft collision" and transfer of the NW Caribbean plate (and Cuba) to the North American plate. Thick sequences of Jurassic- Cretaceous strata (conglomerates, sandstones, limestones, dolostones, shales) and interlayered basaltic rocks characterize passive margin sequences preserved in the Guaniguanico terrane (western Cuba, related to the Mayan passive margin and the Gulf of Mexico) and the Bahamas Platform borderlands (north of Cuba). Passive margin deposition ceased in latest Cretaceous time, when increasing relief of accreted (overriding) oceanic arc and ophiolite complexes shed coarse sediments (olistostrome and flysch), followed by carbonate deposition. Fragments of the intervening oceanic lithosphere (Proto-Caribbean, connected to the Central Atlantic) and fore-And back-Arc oceanic lithosphere (Caribbean, of Pacific origin) occur as tectonic fragments detached from the ophiolitic units, including serpentinized harzburgites and dunites, banded and isotropic gabbros, basalts (tholeiitic and fore-Arc basalts, locally with boninites) and Late Jurassic (Tithonian) through Late Cretaceous (Coniacian and younger) oceanic sediments. Arc activity in the Cuban segment of the Greater Antilles produced sedimentary, volcanic, and plutonic rocks during Cretaceous times (ca. 135-70 Ma). A new arc developed in eastern Cuba during Paleocene-middle Eocene times. Cuban arc sequences include island-Arc tholeiitic, calcalkaline, and alkaline bimodal suites of volcanic and plutonic rocks. Remnants of Proto- Caribbean oceanic lithosphere occur as exhumed melangebearing eclogite-, blueschist-, and garnet-Amphibolite-facies tectonic blocks (oldest age ca. 120 Ma) within a serpentinite matrix intercalated with, or at the base of, the overthrusted ophiolitic bodies. Cuban Cretaceous arc magmatic activity ended due to the subduction of Proto-Caribbean passive margin sequences of the Caribeana terrane, an offshore protuberance of Yucatan. This event formed strongly deformed high-pressure metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks at ca. 70 Ma, when the Caribbean plate began to collide with North America. The collision, which included overriding of the ophiolitic and arc units over both subducted and unsubducted passive margin sequences, also produced synorogenic basins and filled them, a process that continued until ca. 40 Ma. This foldbelt was succeeded by local uplift and subsidence to form late Eocene-Recent unconformable post-orogenic continental basins.},
